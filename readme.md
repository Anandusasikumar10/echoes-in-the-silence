## 🪞 What is this?

This is a terminal-based interactive story,  
where each choice leads you deeper into a space between memory and mystery.

It's built not to rush — but to breathe.  
The main begins with a still moment,  
and your responses shape what unfolds.

## ✨ Why This Exists

I wanted to create something that felt like walking through someone's silence.  
Each moment, each response, is part of a growing emotional field.

Now I’m opening it up —  
for others to leave behind their own *quiet branches*,  
their own *emotional fingerprints* in the story.

## 🔧 For Coders

The main code is in main.py.  
You’ll see how the story flows using simple input(), if/else, and function-based scenes.

### ✅ How You Can Contribute
- Add a new path to an existing scene  
- Write a new character memory or flashback  
- Build your own self-contained “room” or sequence  
- Refactor for structure (optional)

✍️ "To add a new scene, just define a new function at the bottom of main.py and call it where it fits."

## 🖋️ For Writers / Non-Coders

You don’t need to know Python to shape this world.

Open story_contributions.md and:
- Write a scene you'd want to read in this world  
- Add dialogue, thoughts, or branching emotional choices  
- Leave memories that could become part of someone’s path

If it fits, I’ll code it in — or someone else will.
